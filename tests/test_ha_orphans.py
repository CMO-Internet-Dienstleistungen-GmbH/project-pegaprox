"""The config version, the change journal and what a sync does not carry over (#625,
stage two, slice S2).

  * The active steps cv = (epoch, seq) whenever what it hands out changed, in a segment
    of its own; every snapshot names the history its data went through.
  * A member keeps what it holds and a snapshot does not carry (config/ha_orphans)
    before the snapshot wipes it: when its tables changed since its last cv, or its cv
    is not part of the snapshot's history. In every mode. A copy that cannot be written
    refuses the snapshot, and a copy goes only when an admin dismisses it.
  * A copy is sealed: under a key derived from the master key where the database is
    SQLCipher, under the field key on plain SQLite. What copies hold already is not kept
    a second time: an account that is made again after every sync is one copy. Only a
    copy that still opens counts for that, and none goes while a sync looks at them.
  * A member in step reads and hashes nothing before the wipe: the triggers of the tick
    stay on a member and say whether anything was written between two syncs.
  * "Changed here" is decided on the rows, not on the definition of the tables: a column
    an upgrade adds or a table made on first use changes no row.
  * A member never applies a snapshot older than the one it holds from the same leader.
  * A leader whose state went back is found out: by the member that pulls and says what
    it holds, and by the mark every step of the cv has.
  * A new active names the changes it is missing (change_gap).
  * The leader of an automatic group ticks: triggers count the changes, and the walk of
    the shared tables runs only when the count moved.

Several instances in one process, as in test_ha_core: each has a state file of its own,
all share the one test database. The last part runs on the group of test_ha_members and
on the routes of test_ha_api.
