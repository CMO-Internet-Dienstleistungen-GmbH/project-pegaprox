"""The Appropriate Legal Notices have to actually be in the interface.

The NOTICE file makes a §7(b) claim about specific things the program displays.
That claim is only as good as the display: if the login screen, the sidebar or the
About panel stops rendering its notice, the term in NOTICE points at nothing and
the attribution argument goes with it. These assert the two halves stay in step.

Verified in a browser too — present is not the same as on-screen, and the console
window caught exactly that (a fixed overlay sitting on top of the strip). NS
