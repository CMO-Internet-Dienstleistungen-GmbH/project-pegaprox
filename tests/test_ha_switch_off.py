"""The switch back to manual mode is the group's mode only once a majority holds it (#625
stage 2, design 4.13).

The leader writes the manual voter config and sends it with its next round; until a
majority of the voters holds it, the leader's lease is in force and the group fails over
automatically. So everything says automatic until then: the mode route, the status a
member answers, mode() on the leader. A leader that loses its lease before that drops
the config as it leaves - kept, it would be an instance promoted by hand next to the
leader its members elect. A member that took the config from such a leader does not know
whether a majority took it too; it is promoted by hand only once it knows, and never
while a member answers as the holder of a lease. What a failed write costs here: the
role write at the end of the switch is tried again, a config that was not written is
answered 500, and a voter that cannot write its state says so.
