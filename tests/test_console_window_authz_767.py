"""#767 moved the console behind a URL anyone can type. What still gates it?

The in-app path used to be the gate by construction: you only got a console button
for a guest that was already on your screen. A console window is a plain link, so
the whole decision now sits server-side, and these drive the two endpoints a
console window actually calls — the VNC ticket and the LXC termproxy ticket — as
identities that CAN reach the cluster but should not reach the guest.

That distinction is the one that keeps going wrong: check_cluster_access answers
"can this account see the cluster", and its #248 ACL and #555 pool fallbacks
deliberately let a scoped user through so a per-object gate downstream can decide.
Both directions are asserted here — an over-restriction locks a pool user out of
their own guest, which is just as much a bug. NS
