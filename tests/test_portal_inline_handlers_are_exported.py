"""Every inline handler in the client portal has to exist on `window`.

portal.html wraps its script in an IIFE, so nothing declared inside it is global,
while an `onclick="foo()"` attribute resolves against the global scope and nothing
else. A handler that is never re-exported therefore throws ReferenceError and the
button silently does nothing - no error state in the UI, just a dead control.

This has now happened twice: #765 (grobe0ba) for the container create/destroy
buttons, and #810 (GreyChame1eon) for the SSO button, which sat broken from April
to September because nobody clicked it with the console open. Counting the two
lists by hand found it both times; this does the counting.
