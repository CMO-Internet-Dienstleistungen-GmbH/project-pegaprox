"""An open SSE stream has to keep re-checking the account behind it.

The re-check shipped inside the `except queue.Empty` arm of the queue read, which
reads like the idle tick but isn't one: broadcast.py sends a heartbeat frame to
every client once a second, so the queue is never empty and the whole check was
dead. And had it ever run it would have raised — it calls _stream_identity, which
read `request.session`, while the response generator is iterated by the WSGI
server after the request context is gone.

These drive the generator the way the server does: outside a request context. MK
